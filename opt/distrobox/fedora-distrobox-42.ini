# ⚠️ BE CAREFUL:⚠️ With the --root/-r flag, the containers will run as root,
# so root inside the rootful container can modify system stuff outside the
# container. In rootful mode, you’ll be asked to setup the user’s password.
# The isolation and sandboxing is not the main aim of this container, on
# the contrary it aims to tightly integrate the container with the host.
# The container will have complete access to your home, devices, and so on,
# so do not expect it to be highly sandboxed.
